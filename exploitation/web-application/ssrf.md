# Server-side request forgery

Server-side request forgery \(SSRF\) exploits the trusted relationship between a web server and other back-end systems which are not normally accessible to an attacker \(e.g. because of firewalls or application rules\). They are particularly dangerous in cloud infrastructure like AWS, because SSRF allows an attacker to query internal services like [Amazon's metadata API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) for credentials and other sensitive data.

## Techniques

### Basic

Generally, you'll be looking for parameters which accept URLs, either in `GET` or `POST` requests. In the examples below, `localhost` is used in the URL with a port to gain access to another service running on the same server.

Example `GET` request with a vulnerable open redirect:

```text
http://[host]/page?url=http://localhost:123
```

Example `POST` request with a similarly unsanitized URL parameter:

```text
POST /page HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 300

url=http://localhost:123
```

Some SSRF attacks will return a response that you can see on the vulnerable website, but others may be blind.
